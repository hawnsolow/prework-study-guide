## Description

My decision to do this bootcamp is I can switch to a career that will stretch me and push my limits, and give me a meaningful feeling of achievement and success, but also present me with the option to work from home to be with my family.
I built this website to help me better learn, grow and understand, through hands on experience, of the fundemental steps of a web developers project of the process of building a website via the following: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
This is a resource guide to me and also a showcase of my skills from what i have learned.
I have learned to have a growth mind set. There is nothing I can't learn and everything I have yet to learn.
I have developed basic skills in HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

## Installation

1. Create a repo in GitHub with the issues to layout the small steps of the project.
2. In Gitbash, you will clone that repo.
3. After creating the clone of the main branch, you will create a feature of that main branch.
4. Open that feature branch for coding on VSC then proceed to Work on the coding assignment.
5. Once the desired work has been completed, tested and saved, you will then go back to Gitbash and add it to the feature branch, commit to the repo, switch to the main branch, pull to make sure it is up to date with the remote main branch and then push the feature branch to the repo in GitHub and in there you will create a PR to complete the merging process into the main branch after it has been reviewed.
6. After it has been successfuly merged, you will delete the issue of that particular assignment.
7. Then back to GitBash you will then "switch/checkout" to the main branch and pull to update it once again to keep everything on the same page and keep the control flow smooth.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I have learned from prework and I can choose one topic for me to study first.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
